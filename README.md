# Hun Capstone Introduction
The Capstone Experience is an independent project completed by all Hun Seniors and PGs. It provides opportunities for students to complete in-depth studies or explorations of things that are meaningful to them. 
## Mini Car 
Peter and I decided to build a mini car using Arduino that its motion is controlled by the music(notes/ frequencies) played by his soprano saxophone. The main algorithm we used was the FFT(Fast Fourier Transform), which computes the DFT(Discrete Fourier Transform).

This arduinoFFT library is suitable for our purpose with great consistency and accurarcy --

Very good explaination of the FFT and DFT although it is in Matlab --
